Yes, I know… we've missed a lot of the recordings.  There's a lot of missing gameplay between our last stream and newest recording.  I've had a LOT of technical issues recording and streaming lately, and I blame it mainly on my horrible internet connection - which will be resolved soon.  I was finally able to work out an alternative recording method using different software that didn't require as much available bandwidth.  But then I kept having other, non-internet related, issues.  Some of them were technical, some of them were "me" issues (like not unmuting the audio inputs before recording).  I was FINALLY able to get everything fixed up and we do have a good recording for our latest session on December 2.

Here's what happened in between…

We last left our group searching the camp and speaking with various guards and raiders, trying to get whatever information they could, but without appearing too suspicious.  Once they completed their investigation of the camp (which was slightly hampered by Drakul looking vaguely like one of the camp's leaders), the group devised a plan to approach the main tent and attempt to speak with the leaders of the camp.  Using disguise self, Timmothy altered his appearance to resemble Drakul - a blue dragonborn - although looking older and more battleworn.  Tim then assisted Erendriel in disguising himself as one of the guards stationed near the main entrance to the camp.  Their plan was that Timmothy was actually Woodford, a member of Drakul's (or Jameson's, in this case) clan, WuTan and the group had convinced Erendriel, disguised as Daario Shade, to let them into the camp and escort them to speak with leadership of the cult.

The WuTan clan then approached the rear of the camp, where the largest tent stood.  Things did not go exactly as planned though.  When the party approached the tent, they were stopped by the senior guards that surrounded the area.  When asked what their business was and who these outsiders were, Erendriel had a bit of difficulty articulating their reasoning for being there.  The guards did not believe what he was saying and ordered them to stay where they were.  Erendriel then attempted to retreat back to his "post", and was quickly shot with a crossbow bolt for not following orders.  He stayed put then.

Jameson and Woodford asked to speak with the leader of the camp, under the guise that they were there to provide assistance to the cult, as they held shared interests.  The guards, while being sceptical, did not wish to upset their leader with refusal of this curious offer, and went inside the tent to speak with the blue half-dragon.  After a few minutes, the half-dragon approached the party, but not believing a word they were saying, quickly ordered them to be apprehended.  At this point, the party was stripped of their weapons, bound with rope, and secured near Leosin - the monk they were sent to rescue.

Another woman came out of the tent to question them, and again not believing their story, but also armed with the report from the rear guard that they talked their past, suspected they were intruders.  She ordered them executed the following morning.

Later in the evening, after briefly speaking with Leosin, they began their escape attempt.  Drakul attempted to use brute strength to break through his bindings, but the tightness of the rope around his arms made it nearly impossible.  Timmah took a different approach, and broke his own thumb to slide the ropes around his wrist off and then was able to reach some of the other knots.  With Timmah free, he quickly assisted the others, including Leosin, and the group quickly started making their way through the shadows towards the camp entrance.

The guards quickly noticed their absence, and soon the camp was on alert.  However, the party was able to avoid detection and made it to the - still well guarded - front of the camp.  Convincing the guards that Erendriel needed to exit the camp for a nature call and that the simpleton would get lost without help, they were allowed to leave.  The quickly ran the woodline and hid among the bushes, as word spread throughout the camp, and to the entrance guards, of their escape.  But, our intrepid adventurers did manage to avoid detection by slipping deeper into the woods and eventually making their way far enough from the camp.  Leosin was able to lead them back to Greenest and into safety.

Arriving back at Greenest, Governor Nighthill was quickly summoned.  After discussion about what they found in the camp, the Governor paid them their 250gp each - as promised.  At this point, Leosin asked them to return to the camp, but in secret this time.  He still needed to keep an eye on the cultists' movements and activities - it was vital to his mission.  After some convincing (and an offer of 150gp each), he was finally able to convince them to return.  In addition, our party gains another member - Scarlett Grimsborne - a half-elf warlock.  Outfitted with loaner weapons and a spyglass, the party set back out that evening in order to approach under the cover of darkness.

Keeping a distance as they approach, Timmah used the spyglass to check out the entrance of the camp - and saw no guards and no one in the tower.  They continued along the southern edge of the camp, staying on the top of the cliff out of sight.  They find the camp to be mostly abandonded, with only 4 individuals around a fire near the middle of the camp.  The group continued to make their way along the edge of camp, seeing much of the same everywhere.  Once they finally made their way to the cave entrance, Timmothy is lowered down to the base of the cliff to investigate.  He peers into the mouth of the cave and saw a single guard standing watch a short distance inside.  Satisfied, he moved back out of the cave, and yelled back up for Scarlett to come down.

Hearing that yell, the guard came out to investigate and as Scarlett is climbing down, Timmah cast charm person on the guard, convincing him that he is his friend.  They went into the cave, where Timmah very quickly saw a second guard and attempted to cast charm person on him as well.  It failed.  The guard attacked, but the charmed guard de-escalated the situation and the second guard reluctantly put his weapon away.  He remained suspicious of the newcomer, however.

Scarlett made her way down the cliff wall safely.
Drakul and Erendriel decided that Drakul would go down first, but Erendriel couldn't hold the weight of Drakul on the rope, so Drakul just climbed down the cliff wall with little difficulty.
Seeing how easy of a time Drakul had, Erendriel attempted the same thing.  He made it about 20 feet down before he lost his grip and fell the remaining 100+ feet down to the floor of the camp below.

Once Scarlett and Erendriel were (somewhat) safely down, they made their way into the cave to meet up with Timmah and were introduced as his hunting companions.  Inside, they learned that their confiscated gear was located somewhere in the cave complex, as well as the blue half-dragon.

Drakul snuck into the cave unseen, and when the time was right, he struck down the still suspicious guard with one blow.  Scarlett gave the other guard a "poison kiss" and they made very quick work of taking him down.

At this point, our group began exploring the cave complex.  Inside, they found multiple kobolds, some vicious fungus, and a swarm of bats.  Nothing too remarkable to report on there.  As Timmah descended the stairs into another area, he saw a kobold in the next room.  He quickly charged into that room, and discovered that was not just one kobold, but a dozen of them in this chamber.

That brings us up to date on what's happened during our missing recordings.  You can pick the story back up with [here](https://youtu.be/rTGRW1PGmxY)
